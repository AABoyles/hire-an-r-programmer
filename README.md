# Where can I find an `R` programmer?

_Here!_

We are all `R` programmers. Statisticians, coders, quants, et cetera. If you want data analysed we can help you. This is a place where you can find out how to contact us.

This is just a peek at the `R` community&mdash;who's involved in what packages, what people like to work on, who constitutes the community. `R` people also hang out [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Rstats), [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), and [here](http://www.google.com/search?q=stat.ethz.ch+pipermail) for example.



If the developer's name is ~~struck through~~ then they are not currently looking for work. Hey, at least you got to learn who's who.

If you are an `R` developer and want your details added to this list, just fork this, submit a pull request, and I'll approve as long as [a] there are no typoes and [b] you are not lying. tweet @isomorphisms if I don't seem to be paying attention.
